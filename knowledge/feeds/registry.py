"""config.toml [sources] names -> adapter instances. Unknown names refuse.

The scoping judgement in details/10 stands: wiring all 32 keyless sources
because they are free would produce a queue nobody reads. What this registry
adds is the SEAM - enabling a source is one line of config once an entry
exists here, and a name with no entry raises instead of silently ingesting
nothing.
